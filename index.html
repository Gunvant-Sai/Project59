        <p>
        Everday i come from home from school I start doing my stuff. And then after doing my stuff I scamper outside the home to play i play 5:00pm to 7:30pm in weekdays and in holidays 5:00pm to 9:30pm or 10:30pm. I play for so long but some times i come early in the holidays, Because sometimes i dont get to do much and the games are boring or there is no people or only less people.And mostly we Badminton orelse kabbadhi orelse football orelse etc.

        <a class="article" href="https://www.espn.in/football/" target="_blank">The man most responsible for the transition from this rugby-like game to the sport of football we know today was Walter Camp, known as the “Father of American Football.” As a Yale undergraduate and medical student from 1876 to 1881, he played halfback and served as team captain, equivalent to head coach at the time.
